## Logic/Motivation 
![ðŸ˜¤](motivation.jpeg)

- got my machine overloaded by docker desktop app ðŸ˜‚(4G load on idle wtf?? docker ðŸ˜‚), i needed some basic containers php/mysql and so on 
- the first implementation is based on alpine mini root image (3.1 Mb)
- is using chroot for accesing the container (match native performance no unecessary bloat ðŸ˜…)

## Downside
![ðŸ˜…](downside.jpeg)
- it lacks many features docker and other container managers provide (networking setup & large images database)
